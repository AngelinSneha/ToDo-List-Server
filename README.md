# ToDo App
<br />

**_A basic todo application created using Adonis_**
<br />

_Note: This particular repository contains only Back-end files_
<br />
- Database used: mySQL
<br />
- All routes are present in <a href="https://github.com/AngelinSneha/ToDo-List-Server/blob/master/start/routes.ts">routes.ts file</a>.
<br />
- I have used a middleware auth so that only logged in users can access the ToDo List. All fields are validated
<br />
- This project contains 2 main models, Todo.ts: Stores the list of tasks along with respective user_id as foreign key and User.ts: Stores the user details along with tokens.

## Getting Started

- Enter your private keys and password in .env file as shown in sample file .env.example

- After building the app, your backend server will be available at http://localhost:3333
